    #
    #Description: The getPlacement method corresponds to the
    #action taken on setup phase 1 and setup phase 2 of the game.
    #In setup phase 1, the AI player will be passed a copy of the
    #state as currentState which contains the board, accessed via
    #currentState.board. The player will then return a list of 11 tuple
    #coordinates (from their side of the board) that represent Locations
    #to place the anthill and 9 grass pieces. In setup phase 2, the player
    #will again be passed the state and needs to return a list of 2 tuple
    #coordinates (on their opponent's side of the board) which represent
    #Locations to place the food sources. This is all that is necessary to
    #complete the setup phases.

    #   currentState - The current state of the game at the time the Game is
    #       requesting a placement from the player.(GameState)

    #Description: The getMove method corresponds to the play phase of the game

    #constants which can be referred to in Constants.py. The move object has a
    #field for type (moveType) as well as field for relevant coordinate
    #information (coordList). If for instance the player wishes to move an ant,
    #they simply return a Move object where the type field is the MOVE_ANT constant
    #and the coordList contains a listing of valid locations starting with an Ant
    #and containing only unoccupied spaces thereafter. A build is similar to a move
    #except the type is set as BUILD, a buildType is given, and a single coordinate
    #is in the list representing the build location. For an end turn, no coordinates
    #are necessary, just set the type as END and return.
    #
    #Parameters:
    #   currentState - The current state of the game at the time the Game is
    #       requesting a move from the player.(GameState)

    #Description: The getAttack method is called on the player whenever an ant completes
    #a move and has a valid attack. It is assumed that an attack will always be made
    #because there is no strategic advantage from withholding an attack. The AIPlayer
    #is passed a copy of the state which again contains the board and also a clone of
    #the attacking ant. The player is also passed a list of coordinate tuples which
    #represent valid locations for attack. Hint: a random AI can simply return one of
    #these coordinates for a valid attack.

    #Parameters:
    #   currentState - The current state of the game at the time the Game is requesting
    #       a move from the player. (GameState)
